## Summary

This application is just a small demo application utilizing Redux and some dummy JSON data, to show how we can store data to our store, fetch it, and also update it and have it persist in the browser (until cache is cleared). Rather than using a CSS utility framework like Tailwind, we're using Chakra UI component library and styling utilities. This application is written to be scalable, so you could pull out the JSON data fetching in place of an API call via Axios or GraphQL if you desired.
